# Dog-Classifier-31006

Trial and Error

In this project, our aim is to utilize machine learning to distinguish between various breeds of dogs. We will be leveraging data from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition, which comprises over 10,000 labeled images representing 120 distinct dog breeds.

This task falls under the category of multi-class image classification, where we endeavor to classify numerous breeds of dogs. In contrast, binary classification would involve distinguishing between just two categories, such as dogs and cats.

Multi-class image classification holds significant importance as it mirrors the technology employed by companies like Tesla for self-driving cars and Airbnb for automatically enhancing listing information.

The primary focus of this project lies in preparing the data, which entails converting it into numerical format. We'll follow a TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow, consisting of the following steps:

- 1. Data preparation: Downloading from Kaggle, storing, and importing.
- 2. Data preprocessing: Organizing into the three sets (training, validation, and testing), and representing features (X) and labels (y).
- 3. Model selection and training: Utilizing TensorFlow Hub, tf.keras.applications, and incorporating TensorBoard and EarlyStopping techniques.
- 4. Model evaluation: Generating predictions and comparing them with the actual labels to assess model performance.
- 5. Iterative model improvement: Starting with a smaller dataset (e.g., 1000 images) to validate functionality, then gradually increasing the dataset size for refinement.

By following this structured workflow, we aim to develop an effective model for dog breed identification through experimentation and optimization.
